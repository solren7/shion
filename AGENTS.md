Logs: a `tracing` subscriber is installed in `main.rs` (`init_tracing`) — without
it every `info!`/`warn!`/`debug!` is a silent no-op. Output goes to stderr
(launchd captures the gateway's via the plist's `StandardErrorPath` →
`~/.komo/logs/gateway.err.log`; Docker reads it via `docker logs`), and the
gateway additionally tees into a daily-rotated file
(`~/.komo/logs/gateway.YYYY-MM-DD.log`, 30 files kept, the appender deletes
older ones — `main.rs::open_gateway_log`), which is what `komo logs` reads. Level is `KOMO_LOG` (e.g. `KOMO_LOG=debug`),
defaulting to `info,toasty=warn,rig_core=warn` (komo's own logs at info; ORM
schema chatter muted; and rig's `prompt_request` INFO events muted — they log
every tool call's *full result* verbatim, a wall of text for any list-returning
tool). Each turn runs inside a `run` span (`run_id`) and each tool call inside a
`tool` span (`name`/`seq`) and is recorded by komo's own concise `tool ok`
line (name/seq/elapsed, no result), so live logs still line up with the
persisted run ledger. Set `KOMO_LOG=debug` (or `rig_core=info`) to see the full
tool results again.

`~/.komo/state.db` is disposable developer state (sessions, messages, session
todos, skills, reminders, pairings, settings, **run ledger**) — delete it freely
to reset.
Two kinds of **durable personal data live in their own files** so resetting
`state.db` never wipes them: cross-session **tasks in `~/.komo/kanban.db`**
(`infra/persistence/kanban.rs`) and long-term **memories in `~/.komo/memory.db`**
(`infra/memory/memory_db.rs`). After a schema change on **disposable** state,
delete the affected file — `push_schema` only runs for newly created database
files: a `TaskRecord` change means deleting `kanban.db`, any other model means
`state.db` (e.g. a `RunRecord`/`RunStepRecord` change — the run ledger lives in
`state.db`). **Column additions can skip the reset**: the shared
`infra/persistence/mod.rs::ensure_columns` runs an additive `ALTER TABLE ADD
COLUMN` in place on connect — `memory.db` uses it for every `MemoryRecord`
column (durable data must never need a reset; extend the `EXPECTED` list in
`memory_db.rs`), and `state.db` uses it for `SessionRecord` columns (see
`SESSION_COLUMNS` in `db.rs::connect` — extend it when adding a column, so an
upgraded gateway doesn't hard-fail on the old file until someone remembers to
delete it). Columns must be NOT NULL with a DEFAULT, or nullable. A new *table*
or any non-additive change still means deleting the disposable file.

**Running the CLI while the gateway is up.** Turso takes an *exclusive
cross-process lock* on each db file (no multi-process open), so while the gateway
runs it is the sole owner of all three dbs — a CLI that opened one directly would
fail with `File is locked by another process`. So the gateway runs an **always-on
loopback api channel** (`infra/messaging/api.rs`) and advertises it in
`~/.komo/gateway.json` (`infra/rendezvous.rs`: bind/port/auto-key/pid, written on
start, removed on graceful shutdown). Every **operator** action goes through
`services/operator_control/` — the CLI resolves one `OperatorControl::connect`
per invocation (probe the rendezvous file → `/health`, exactly once) and issues
typed `OperatorQuery`/`OperatorCommand` calls; whichever backend answered is
invisible to the command modules. The **gateway adapter** maps those onto the
existing `/api/*` routes via `infra/gateway_client.rs::GatewayClient` (reads
deserialize the domain types verbatim; writes hit the loopback-gated `POST`
endpoints — memory promote/reject/pin, `runs/prune`, `sessions/clean`,
`pairings/approve|revoke`, `dream/apply`, `runs/{id}/resume`). The **direct
adapter** opens the stores lazily per request family (a `run list` never
touches memory.db; a triage batch reuses one connection), so there is no "stop
the gateway first" refusal. Business results can't fork between the two paths:
both run the shared projections/transitions in `operator_control/actions.rs`
(`OperatorActions` is the same bundle the api channel's handlers delegate to,
and transition semantics live on `Memory::promote/reject/pin`). `run resume`
keeps eligibility, the priming digest, and the at-most-once `recoverable` clear
inside `OperatorControl::resume_run`; only the interactive local turn is a
caller-supplied closure over the already-open stores. `komo chat` is the one
non-operator path: the TUI connects via `GatewayClient::chat` →
`POST /v1/chat/completions` with a stable `X-Komo-Session-Id` (server-side
history) and `X-Komo-Trusted` (the gateway runs the turn with
`SessionContext::trusted` → side-effecting tools **auto-approve**, since the CLI
user is the host operator; gated to **loopback** callers, so a publicly-bound api
never gets it). `/pair approve` in chat remains the other in-gateway admission
path. The api channel is loopback-only on an ephemeral port by default;
`[channels.api] enabled = true` widens it to an external bind/port (requires
`API_SERVER_KEY`) for Open WebUI / the dashboard. Two further `[channels.api]`
options serve the web client (`apps/web`): `web_dir = "…/apps/web/dist"` serves
that built SPA same-origin as the router's fallback (static assets are public,
like `/health`; `/api` + `/v1` stay key-gated — so no CORS is involved), and
`remote_interactive = true` lets **keyed remote** (non-loopback) callers run
interactive turns (`X-Komo-Interactive`) and resolve approval/clarify prompts
over `/api/interactions/*` (off by default — those assume a host operator behind
a loopback socket; `X-Komo-Trusted` auto-approve stays loopback-only regardless).

Building requires `protoc` (`brew install protobuf`): the feishu channel's websocket
frames are protobuf, and `lark-websocket-protobuf` compiles its `.proto` at build time.

Runtime settings (provider/model/base_url/aux_model, maintenance `schedule`,
the opt-in daily `briefing_schedule` + its `briefing_workdays_only` gate, the
`dream_schedule` for usage-driven memory consolidation (on by default, nightly
`0 3 * * *`; set to `"off"` to disable), the
`[channels.*]` tables) live in
`~/.komo/config.toml`; credentials (API keys,
`FEISHU_APP_ID` / `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `HASS_TOKEN`) only
in `~/.komo/.env`. Priority: built-in defaults < config.toml < `KOMO_*` env
vars. `KOMO_HOME` relocates the whole directory.

The `codex` provider (`provider = "codex"`) is the exception to the API-key
rule: it has no env key, authenticating instead from the Codex CLI's OAuth login
at `~/.codex/auth.json` (run `codex` to create it; `$CODEX_HOME` honored). See
`infra/codex.rs` in the Architecture section.

Home Assistant keeps its URL and token in `.env` as a single self-contained
block: `HASS_TOKEN` (required — a long-lived access token) and `HASS_URL`
(optional, defaults to `http://homeassistant.local:8123`). These are shared by
both HA surfaces. No token = neither the `homeassistant` tool nor the channel
loads.

```bash
# ~/.komo/.env
HASS_TOKEN=your-long-lived-access-token
HASS_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8123   # optional; omit for homeassistant.local:8123
```

The `homeassistant` **tool** (agent controls HA) registers automatically once
`HASS_TOKEN` is set — no config.toml needed. The HA **event channel** (HA
pushes device events to the agent) is opt-in via `[channels.homeassistant]`,
which carries only event-filter behavior (URL/token still come from `.env`).
Forwarding is closed by default — set at least one of `watch_domains` /
`watch_entities` / `watch_all`:

```toml
[channels.homeassistant]
enabled = true
watch_domains = ["binary_sensor", "lock", "alarm_control_panel"]
watch_entities = ["cover.garage_door"]
ignore_entities = ["binary_sensor.always_chatty"]
watch_all = false            # forward every entity (overrides the watch lists)
cooldown_seconds = 30        # per-entity min seconds between forwarded events
```

Config resolution: `src/config/` resolves everything **once** into a
`ConfigSnapshot { runtime: RuntimeConfig, report: ConfigReport }`.
`sources.rs` reads the three raw sources one time (dotenvy loads `.env` into
the process env in `main.rs`; envy deserializes `KomoEnv` for `KOMO_*` and
`Secrets` for every credential; `FileConfig` parses config.toml) and
`resolved.rs` applies precedence/defaults purely — `from_sources` is the test
seam, so resolution tests never touch the real env. Resolution **never
aborts**: problems become `ConfigIssue`s in the report (with per-value
provenance, secrets redacted to presence-only), and startup paths fail fast via
`validate_agent` (env/model issues — wiring calls it) or `validate_gateway`
(any fatal issue, e.g. an enabled channel missing its credential —
`gateway::run` calls it). Two deliberate exceptions: a **missing model API key
is a warning, not fatal** — a fresh install (first Docker boot, before `komo
init` + a key exists) must boot rather than crash-loop, so `build_llm` degrades
to an `UnconfiguredLlm` whose every call errors with the fix, and that message
reaches the user as the turn's reply. And **`[channels.homeassistant]` enabled
without `HASS_TOKEN` is also a warning** — HA is a local convenience
integration, so the gateway boots with the channel offline (`Misconfigured`,
skipped by wiring's `.ready()`) instead of taking every other channel down. `komo init` scaffolds `config.toml` +
`.env` (`cli/init.rs`, pure file ops, never overwrites). `cli/app.rs` loads the snapshot once per invocation
and threads `&ConfigSnapshot` to chat/gateway/doctor/model/policy; channel
tri-state (disabled / ready / misconfigured) is `ChannelState<T>`. Never
re-read config.toml or call `std::env::var` in callers — the only exception is
`KOMO_HOME`, the bootstrap variable that locates `.env` itself.

Channel declarations follow hermes-agent's per-platform block shape — behavior
keys in the table, credentials in env:

```toml
[channels.feishu]
enabled = true
allow_from = ["ou_xxx"]   # pre-trusted sender open_ids (skip pairing)
require_mention = true     # group messages must carry an @mention (DMs bypass)
home_chat = "oc_xxx"      # optional: reminders go here instead of macOS notifications

[channels.telegram]
enabled = true
allow_from = ["123456789"]  # pre-trusted sender user-ids (skip pairing)
allowed_chats = ["-100123"]  # group chat-id allowlist (empty = any group; DMs always pass)
require_mention = true       # group messages must @mention the bot (DMs bypass)
home_chat = "123456789"     # optional: reminders go here instead of macOS notifications

[channels.wechat]
enabled = true
allow_from = ["wxid_xxx"]   # pre-trusted iLink user-ids (skip pairing)
home_chat = "wxid_xxx"      # optional: reminders go here instead of macOS notifications
```

WeChat (微信) has no credentials in config.toml or `.env`: login is QR-based and
the iLink token is stored in `~/.komo/wechat/credentials.json`. Provision it
once on the host with `komo channel wechat login` (scan the QR with the WeChat app); the
gateway can't render a QR, so its `[channels.wechat]` is **inert until those
credentials exist**. WeChat is DM-only (an iLink bot identity can't join ordinary
groups), so there is no `require_mention`/`allowed_chats` — pairing is the only
admission control. Proactive output (reminders/briefing) reaches a WeChat user
only after they've messaged the bot since the gateway started — see the channel
note below.

When multiple channels set `home_chat`, feishu takes reminder delivery. The
config `home_chat` is only a fallback: the `/sethome` chat command sets the home
channel at runtime (persisted in the db), and that override wins. See the
`HomeNotifier` in the gateway section below.

Senders outside `allow_from` must pair before the agent talks to them: their
first message gets a pairing code as the only reply, and someone with shell
access to the host runs `komo pair approve <code>`. Pairing is hardened after
hermes' `pairing.py` (`domain/pairing.rs`): the code is stored only as a salted
SHA-256 hash (never plaintext, so `komo pair list` shows pending/approved but
not the code — get it from the sender), a sender is issued at most one fresh
code per 10 min (`PAIRING_RATE_LIMIT_SECS`; codes still expire after 1h), at
most 3 senders may await approval per platform (`MAX_PENDING_PER_PLATFORM`), and
the approve path locks for 1h after 5 wrong codes (`APPROVE_MAX_FAILURES`).
`komo pair revoke <id>` un-pairs. Approval is written to the shared db, so it
takes effect on the sender's next message without a gateway restart.

## Architecture

Personal Agent framework v0.1, implemented in Rust. The codebase follows a DDD-style layered architecture.

**Request flow:**
```
CLI/channel → AgentRuntime ─ run_agent_loop ─┬→ LlmClient::begin_turn → TurnDriver (ONE rig completion / round)
                                             └→ ToolExecutor::execute_round → tools   (loop until Step::Final)
                          ↘ MessageRepository · RunRepository (ledger) → Response
```
komo owns the tool loop (roadmap §7): `AgentRuntime::run_agent_loop` drives the model one
round at a time via `LlmClient::begin_turn` — rig performs a **single** completion per round,
not its own multi-step loop — and hands each round of requested tools to the `ToolExecutor`,
threading the results back until the model returns a final answer. A hard per-turn round
budget (`max_turns`) forces a clean final answer once exceeded. There is still no separate
planner *type* — the loop is this one method, which is where control points (budget today;
clarify/resume next) live.

**Layers and their responsibilities:**

`domain/` — pure interfaces, no I/O, no external crates
- `repository.rs` — `SessionRepository` (find/save) and `MessageRepository` (list_by_session/save); the two traits `AgentRuntime` depends on
- `tool.rs` — `Tool` trait (name / description / execute / optional `redact_args` / optional `idempotent`); `idempotent` (default `false`) opts a read-only tool into retry on an ambiguous transient failure — see `tool_registry.rs`
- `message.rs`, `session.rs` — core value types

`infra/` is layered by concern: `infra/messaging/` (ingress channels, outbound
senders, proactive notifiers), `infra/memory/` (the memory.db connection +
legacy markdown store), `infra/persistence/` (the toasty-backed state.db /
kanban.db connections), and two cross-cutting files at the top level —
`infra/llm.rs` (LLM backend) and `infra/rig_tool.rs` (the Tool→rig adapter).

`infra/persistence/db.rs` + `infra/persistence/kanban.rs` + `infra/memory/memory_db.rs` — the only places toasty (ORM) appears. The backend is the **Turso engine** (`toasty-driver-turso`, the pure-Rust SQLite rewrite — no `rusqlite`/C dep), opened in **MVCC concurrent-write mode** (`Turso::file(p).concurrent_writes()`)
- `Db` (`infra/persistence/db.rs`) holds `Arc<toasty::Db>` over `state.db`; implements every repository trait *except* `TaskRepository`/`MemoryRepository`/`SkillRepository` (sessions, messages, reminders, session todos, pairings, settings, the **run ledger** `RunRepository`). Skills moved to files (`infra/skills.rs`); the `SkillRecord` table stays in the schema only so `export_legacy_skills` can read old dbs for the one-time candidate import
- `KanbanDb` (`infra/persistence/kanban.rs`) is a second, independent connection over `kanban.db`; it holds only `TaskRecord` and implements `TaskRepository`. Separate file = durable tasks survive a `state.db` reset
- `MemoryDb` (`infra/memory/memory_db.rs`) is a third, independent connection over `memory.db`; it holds only `MemoryRecord` and implements `MemoryRepository`. On first run it seeds itself from legacy `~/.komo/memory/*.md` via `import_legacy_markdown` (no-op once populated)
- **connection pool, no global lock**: `toasty::Db` is itself a deadpool-backed pool, so each repository method does `self.inner.connection().await?` and runs on its own pooled `Connection` (`Connection: Executor`) — independent reads/writes run concurrently. No `Arc<Mutex>`. Pool size is `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` (`infra/persistence/mod.rs`)
- **MVCC writes retry**: under `concurrent_writes`, conflicting commits fail and must be retried by the caller. Every **single-write** mutating repository method (the run ledger — a round's tool calls run in parallel — plus message/task/memory saves, and the skill/reminder/session-todo/pairing/home upserts) wraps its body in `with_write_retry` (`infra/persistence/mod.rs`), which re-runs the whole closure on a busy/conflict error. **Multi-write** methods (`rotate`, `prune`, `reconcile_interrupted`, pairing `approve_code`) wrap their statements in a real toasty transaction (`conn.transaction()` → `.commit()`; drop = rollback) *inside* `with_write_retry` — so a mid-sequence failure or lost MVCC commit rolls the whole sequence back and the retry re-runs it cleanly, never double-applying. (`delete_empty_sessions` stays a plain loop — its per-row deletes are independent and idempotent.) `SessionRepository::save` is an idempotent create: it pre-checks existence and inserts only when absent (retrying conflicts), rather than the old `let _ = create!(…)` that swallowed *every* error — including a conflict that left the session uncreated and the next message save failing with a phantom "session not found". MVCC rejects `AUTOINCREMENT`, so every key is a `String` (UUIDv7 via `uuid::Uuid::now_v7()`), never `#[auto]`
- **sqlite→turso migration**: a legacy rusqlite-written file is staged aside to `<name>.sqlite-backup` (`stage_sqlite_backup`), its rows extracted via the still-enabled `sqlite` driver and reloaded into a fresh Turso db, then a `<name>.turso` marker is written so it never re-migrates. Durable data (memory.db, kanban.db) migrates its rows; disposable `state.db` is just staged aside and rebuilt. Both `sqlite` and `turso` toasty features stay enabled (the former only to read backups)
- all: `connect(url)` checks if the db file exists; calls `push_schema()` only for new databases (toasty's `push_schema` is not idempotent — no `IF NOT EXISTS`; adding a table to an existing file means deleting it, or the `.sqlite-backup`/`.turso` sidecars, to rebuild)
- toasty model structs are private to their file
- DB URL format: `turso:<path>` (single colon); `turso::memory:` for in-memory. The old `sqlite:<path>` form is still understood by the migration's backup reader

`agent/runtime.rs` — application logic
- `AgentRuntime` holds `Arc<dyn LlmClient>` + a `ToolExecutor` (the loop hands it each round of requested calls) + `max_turns` + `Arc<dyn SessionRepository>` + `Arc<dyn MessageRepository>` + `Arc<dyn RunRepository>` — no knowledge of toasty
- `handle_input` owns the session lifecycle: load-or-create, append the user message, run the turn, persist the reply
- `turn_body` loads only a **recent window** of the transcript (`SessionRepository::find_windowed(id, history_window)`, where `history_window` mirrors the LLM's `max_history_messages`; `0` = whole transcript) — so a long-lived chat session no longer deserializes its full history every turn. The LLM windows again to the same bound, so this is loss-free. The periodic reviewer cadence is driven by `MessageRepository::count_user_turns` (a cheap `COUNT(*)`, since the windowed in-memory count would plateau and mis-fire the modulo), and when it fires the reviewer is handed a **full** reload via `find` (it needs the whole transcript, not the working window)
- `run_agent_loop` is komo's own tool-calling loop (roadmap §7): `llm.begin_turn` → `first()` → on `Step::ToolCalls`, hand the whole round to `ToolExecutor::execute_round` with an explicit `ToolTurnContext` (the run handle this turn opened + the session context, read once at the loop's start — the one ambient-to-explicit bridge) → `step(outcomes)` → repeat until `Step::Final`. Tool errors and unknown names come back as outcome content (the model recovers); only a driver/LLM error aborts the turn. Past the `max_turns` round budget it feeds a "budget reached" note in place of results and forces a final answer
- `run_turn` wraps each turn in one ledger `Run` (open → pass a `RunContext` explicitly into `turn_body` + a `run` tracing span → finalize with status/output/error). There is no run task-local: ledgering never depends on ambient scope. All ledger writes are best-effort (logged, never change the turn result). `Run.plan` is a post-hoc summary derived from the recorded step count ("respond" or "<n> tool call(s)")

`domain/llm.rs` — `LlmClient`: `complete(&Session) -> String` (one-shot, tool-less — delegate/reviewer/briefing) plus `begin_turn(&Session) -> Box<dyn TurnDriver>`, the seam `run_agent_loop` drives. A `TurnDriver` yields the turn's rounds as `Step` (`Final(String)` | `ToolCalls(Vec<ToolCallReq>)`) and takes `ToolOutcome`s back — all rig-agnostic. `begin_turn` has a default impl (a one-shot driver wrapping `complete`) so tool-less backends and test stubs need only `complete`

`infra/llm.rs` — `RigLlm<M>`: `LlmClient` backed by the `rig` framework (`rig-core`, aliased as `rig`)
- `build_llm` constructs it for the configured provider (deepseek/openai/anthropic/openrouter/**codex**), exposing the tool catalog via function calling; it takes `Option<Arc<MemoryEnricher>>` (`Some` = main agent) rather than raw memory/aux handles
- `assemble` (shared by `complete` and `begin_turn`, run **once per turn**) splits the session into prompt + history, rebuilds the tiered system prompt, and appends the finished memory prefix from the `MemoryEnricher` (main agent only) — the adapter never sees memory selection, screening, rendering, or usage tracking. The stable tier carries an operator-authored **user profile** (`~/.komo/USER.md`, hermes' USER.md analog; main agent only via `SystemPromptBuilder::user_profile()`, re-read on mtime like `SOUL.md`) — deliberately kept separate from the memory-derived pinned/recall blocks (different tier, operator-trusted vs untrusted-data-flagged, hand-authored vs pinned-during-use), so the two profile sources never dedup-fight. `komo init` scaffolds an empty `USER.md`; churny facts still belong in memory.db/AGENTS.md, not the profile
- `begin_turn` returns a `RigTurnDriver` that owns the per-turn agent clone + growing history; each round is one `agent.completion(prompt, history).send()` (rig does a single completion, komo owns the loop). It echoes the assistant turn back verbatim (text + tool calls + reasoning) and threads tool results via rig's own `Message::tool_result[_with_call_id]` (preserving both `id` and `call_id` so Anthropic and OpenAI-style providers both validate). `complete` still uses rig's `agent.prompt().max_turns()` — fine for the tool-less aux paths
- the `stream` flag (set only for the Codex provider) flips both paths to rig's **streaming** completion, aggregating the streamed deltas back into one assistant turn (`stream_completion`) — the Codex backend rejects non-streamed requests, everyone else keeps the one-shot `send()`/`prompt()` path

`infra/codex.rs` — the **Codex provider** (`provider = "codex"`), borrowed from hermes-agent's `openai-codex` OAuth path. Codex models run on the ChatGPT backend (`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`, an OpenAI **Responses API** surface), authenticated not with an env API key but with the OAuth tokens the official Codex CLI writes to `~/.codex/auth.json` (`$CODEX_HOME` honored). `CodexAuth` reads that token set, decodes the access-token JWT to know when it's expiring, and refreshes it against `auth.openai.com/oauth/token` (Codex CLI's pinned client id), writing the result back to `auth.json` so the CLI and komo stay in sync. `CodexHttpClient` is a custom `rig` `HttpClientExt` backend that, on **every** request: re-stamps a freshly-resolved `Authorization: Bearer` (so a long-running gateway survives the hourly token rotation), and reshapes rig's Responses body for the picky Codex backend (`adapt_codex_body`: lift the `system` message into the required top-level `instructions`, force `store: false`). Static Cloudflare-dodging headers (`originator: codex_cli_rs`, codex-shaped `User-Agent`, `ChatGPT-Account-ID` from the JWT) are baked into the client's default headers in `build_llm`; the SSE response, which the backend serves without a `Content-Type`, is stamped `text/event-stream` so rig's stream reader accepts it. No env key: `Provider::uses_api_key()` is false for Codex, so `ModelConfig::resolve` leaves `api_key` empty and `komo doctor` validates `~/.codex/auth.json` instead. Default model `gpt-5.5` (account-/tier-dependent — others seen: `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`; discover live at `GET /codex/models`), overridable via config `model`.

`services/tool_execution/` — the tool-execution module (deepening plan §6): `ToolExecutor` owns the whole pipeline the loop used to assemble by hand
- `ToolExecutor::execute_round(calls, &ToolTurnContext)` is the external interface: one round of model-requested calls in, order-preserving `ToolOutcome`s out (run concurrently — the interactive approver serializes prompts per session, so approvals stay safe). Unknown tools and tool errors become outcome content the model can recover from. `definitions()` is the read-only catalog view `build_llm` uses for function-calling schemas
- inside, each call runs the invariant order: claim a ledger seq (the per-turn call budget counts logical calls, not retry attempts) → redact args (`Tool::redact_args`) → execute on a panic-catching task with the session context installed and a `tool` tracing span → map panic/cancel to errors → **transient-error retry** (typed `RetryHint` from `TransientError` preferred, text markers as fallback; connection-level failures retry any tool, ambiguous ones only `Tool::idempotent()` tools, terminal never; retries collapse into one ledger step) → record the `RunStep` best-effort → cap the LLM-facing result at a UTF-8 boundary with a "narrow your query" marker (after the ledger records the original)
- execution policy is **instance-owned** `ToolExecutionConfig` (`max_result_bytes` from config's `max_tool_result_bytes`; `max_calls_per_turn` = 100 backstop) — no process globals; two executors can carry different policies
- context is **explicit**: the runtime passes `ToolTurnContext { session, run: Option<RunContext> }` per turn. The `SESSION` task-local survives only as an internal compatibility seam (rig's `ToolDyn::call` and `Tool::execute(String)` can't take a context parameter): the dispatcher / api / `handle_input` establish it, the loop reads it once, and the executor re-installs it around each spawned tool task for session-scoped tools (`todo`, `memory`) and the approvers
- `infra/rig_tool.rs::RigTool` adapts each `Tool` into a rig `ToolDyn` for schemas and shares the executor's `ToolExecutionCore`, so its trait-required `call` fallback (not on the hot path) carries identical retry/ledger/cap semantics

`tools/time.rs` — first built-in tool; returns RFC 3339 UTC timestamp

`tools/homeassistant.rs` — `HomeAssistantTool`, the Home Assistant integration (reaches a smart-home instance over its REST API, 15s timeout). Four actions: `list_entities` (read; optional `domain` prefix + `area` filter), `get_state` (read one entity), and `list_services` (discover callable services per domain) are read-only; `call_service` (turn devices on/off, etc.) is side-effecting → gated through the shared `Approver` as `Risk::Normal` with a `homeassistant:{domain}.{service}` scope key (approve-for-session). Two safety floors *below* approval (HA has no service-level access control of its own): `domain`/`service`/`entity_id` are shape-validated (`valid_name` / `valid_entity_id`) to block path-traversal/SSRF in the request path, and a `BLOCKED_DOMAINS` list (`shell_command`, `command_line`, `python_script`, `pyscript`, `hassio`, `rest_command`) is refused outright — no approval unlocks it, like shell's hardline list. Registered only when `HASS_TOKEN` is set (`HASS_URL` optional, defaults to homeassistant.local:8123; resolved by `config::homeassistant_config`, wired in `cli/wiring.rs`)

`infra/messaging/homeassistant.rs` — `HomeAssistantChannel`, HA as an event-ingress channel (`Channel`, like telegram/feishu but event-driven, not conversational). Opens HA's WebSocket API (`/api/websocket`), authenticates with `HASS_TOKEN`, subscribes to `state_changed`; each qualifying event is formatted into a human-readable line (domain-aware: climate/sensor/binary_sensor/light/switch/fan/lock/alarm) and dispatched as one turn under session `homeassistant:events`, with the reply delivered back as an HA persistent notification (`HomeAssistantSender`, also a `TextSender`). Event forwarding is **closed by default** (`Filters`): no `watch_domains`/`watch_entities` + `watch_all=false` ⇒ everything dropped; an `ignore_entities` list and a per-entity `cooldown_seconds` (default 30) cap the rate so a busy home doesn't fire an LLM call per sensor tick. Auto-reconnects with `[5,10,30,60]`s backoff. **No pairing** — it's a trusted local integration keyed by `HASS_TOKEN`, not a chat with arbitrary senders. Declared in `[channels.homeassistant]` (behavior only; URL/token shared with the tool), resolved by `config::homeassistant_channel_config`, wired in `cli/gateway.rs`. Approval-requiring tool calls during an HA-triggered turn are denied (no human at the keyboard), so HA events can read/notify but not perform `Risk::Normal` actions unattended.

`domain/policy.rs` + `agent/policy_approver.rs` — the **configurable permission policy** (roadmap §3): a pure rule engine deciding whether a side-effecting action auto-allows, hard-denies, or escalates to the interactive approver
- `[policy]` + `[[policy.rule]]` in config.toml (parsed by `config::policy_config` / `policy_report`; invalid rules ignored with a warning, absent table = empty policy = ask-for-everything, never more permissive). Rule fields: `category` (shell/file/network/homeassistant), `match` (prefix/suffix/exact/contains), `value`, `effect` (allow/deny), optional `access` (file read/write), `channels` scope, `include_dangerous`, `unattended`
- `PolicyApprover` (same decorator shape as `WorkdayGated`) wraps `CliApprover`/`ChatApprover` in `cli/wiring.rs`: `Policy::decide` runs first, the inner approver only on `Ask`. Deny beats allow regardless of order; `Risk::Dangerous` auto-allows only via `include_dangerous`. **Unattended contexts** (no session — the briefing runtime, sweeps) grant only through an allow rule explicitly marked `unattended = true`; a `default_normal = allow` degrades to Ask there (`Policy::decide` enforces this in the engine, so `komo policy check` without `--channel` shows the real unattended verdict)
- **read-only actions are deny-only**: `web_fetch` (`ActionRef::Network`) and `file` reads (`ActionRef::File{write:false}`) consult the approver at `Risk::Safe` — a deny rule can blackhole hosts (matched on the URL host at dot boundaries, so `suffix github.com` ≠ `evilgithub.com`) or fence paths (`access = "read"`), but nothing ever prompts for a read and unmatched reads stay allowed (allow rules are meaningless there). This is the exfiltration guard: untrusted page content steering the model into fetching an attacker host is blockable in config
- layering: the policy sits *above* each tool's hardline floor (shell's refused patterns, HA's `BLOCKED_DOMAINS`) — those short-circuit inside the tool, so no `Allow` rule can unlock them; policy only tightens, never loosens
- operator surface: `komo policy list` / `komo policy check` (`cli/policy.rs`, pure config parsing — no db/gateway involved) and a `policy:` section in `komo doctor`

`domain/task.rs` + `tools/task.rs` — durable cross-session tasks (roadmap §2's "kanban layer", shaped after hermes-agent), persisted by `KanbanDb` in its own `kanban.db`
- single `Task` model: `status` (`inbox`→`todo`→`done`, plus `waiting`/`cancelled`), `waiting_on` (set = a commitment), optional `due_at`, `source`/`source_message_id` (origin session + dedup key for reviewer commitment extraction, see `ReviewSweep`), `board` (optional project/grouping label — a plain string, not a Project entity; the §2 escape hatch, as hermes does)
- `task` tool actions: `capture` (defaults to inbox) / `list` (filter by `status` and/or `board`) / `update` / `complete`; no `plan_today` — daily planning belongs to the briefing sweep
- operator view: `komo task list` (open tasks grouped by status, board shown as `#board`)
- deliberately NOT modeled: task-to-task dependency edges (`blockedBy`/`blocks`) or `owner` — those serve autonomous worker-swarm orchestration (hermes kanban's `task_links`, Claude Code's Task\* tools), which komo (single-turn personal assistant, no dispatcher) does not have. `waiting_on` covers personal-context blocking.

`domain/todo.rs` + `tools/todo.rs` — session-scoped working focus list (roadmap §2/§8; shaped after hermes `todo_tool` / Claude Code `TodoWrite`)
- `TodoItem { content, status: pending|in_progress|completed|cancelled, active_form }`; list order = priority; at most one `in_progress` (validated on write)
- distinct from `task`: a todo dies with the conversation. Persisted per session (`SessionTodoRecord`, keyed by session id) because komo reloads a session each turn, but it is disposable — the dispatcher clears it on `/new`
- `todo` tool: call with no args to read; pass `todos` to replace the whole list (full-list replace, no merge). Reads the current session from the ambient turn context (`current_session`); inert (no session) for aux sub-agents and sweeps
- the turn's session context is established for BOTH paths: the gateway dispatcher sets it (with a real `ReplySink`), and `AgentRuntime::handle_input` sets a *detached* context (no-op sink) when none exists, so the REPL gets `todo` too — see `SessionContext::detached`

`domain/memory.rs` + `tools/memory.rs` + `infra/memory/memory_db.rs` — long-term memory as three surfaces (roadmap §5)
- `Memory` model is governed and scoped: `kind` (profile/preference/feedback/project/person/fact/decision/reference), `status` (candidate→active, plus archived/rejected), `confidence` (extracted/inferred/confirmed/user_written), `importance`, `pinned`, `scope` (`MemoryScope` global/project/channel/session, serialized as `scope_type`+`scope_key`), `source`/`source_message_id`, timestamps, `expires_at`/`last_used_at`/`recall_count`/`recall_query_hashes` (the dreaming usage signals — see below). `MemoryContext::from_session` derives the turn's `allowed_scopes` from the session id (chat → global+channel+session; CLI → global+session, **never** infers project from chat). Governance transitions live on the model (`Memory::promote/reject/pin`) so the CLI, the api channel, and the `memory` tool share one definition
- **L1 pinned** (done): `select_pinned` filters `is_pinnable` (pinned + active + confirmed/user_written + identity-kind + in-scope); `services/memory_enrichment.rs` renders an ≤800-char block appended **after** the volatile tier (cache-stable), marked `<!-- komo:memory:pinned -->`, flagged as untrusted data. Main agent only (the enricher is `Some` only there); aux/delegate get none
- **L2 tool/governance** (done): `memory` tool `save/search/list/update/promote/reject/archive`; `search` is scope-bounded (`MemoryQuery` + `rerank_score`: lexical `LIKE` + importance/confidence/recency, no embedding). Operator CLI `komo memory list/search/promote/reject/pin/triage` (promote/reject take multiple ids; `triage` walks the candidate pile oldest-first with p/r/s/q; all three writes route through a running gateway — see the api-channel note above). `pin` is the manual-only path into L1 — automated extraction never pins
- reviewer writes extractions as `candidate + extracted`, scoped to the origin channel, deduped against the memory store loaded once per review (a `seen_keys` set over each session's `source_message_id`s — same governance as task inbox, where the dedup is still `TaskRepository::find_by_source_message_id`); user triages candidates up to active/pinned
- **L3 active recall** (done): `MemoryRepository::recall(ctx, text, limit)` scores active, in-scope memories against the turn's user message by **token overlap** (`recall_terms` = ASCII words + CJK bigrams + stopword filter; `recall_score`), distinct from L2 `search`'s whole-query substring match. **Fetch wide, inject narrow**: the enricher pulls up to `recall_fetch`=15 candidates; ≤`RECALL_LIMIT`=5 survivors inject directly (zero added latency), more get screened by the **aux recall agent** (`aux_select_recall` on the cheap `aux_model`: pick ≤5 genuinely relevant, optionally condense each to one line; strict-JSON reply validated against the candidate set — fabricated ids and oversized rewrites dropped, so aux output can never inject non-memory content; timeout 4s or any failure falls back to the lexical top 5). The kept hits render into an ≤2000-char block (each line `source:`-tagged, untrusted caveat, `<!-- komo:memory:recall -->`), appended **after** pinned (fixed `volatile | pinned | recall` order; pinned hits deduped out of recall). All of this lives in `services/memory_enrichment.rs::MemoryEnricher` — one interface (`enrich(session_id, user_message) → Option<MemoryPrefix>`) whose behavior tests inject fakes through the `MemoryRepository`/`LlmClient` seams. Recall failure is non-fatal but `warn!`-logged. **Recall surfaces both `Active` and `Candidate`** (only `Archived`/`Rejected` excluded) — a candidate must be recallable to *earn* its usage signal for dreaming; it scores lower and is confidence-tagged in the block. Only the **injected** memories get `recall_count` bumped, `last_used_at` stamped, and the turn's query fingerprint (`recall_query_hash`: sorted normalized terms → 16-hex SHA-256 prefix) recorded into `recall_query_hashes` (deduped, capped at `RECALL_QUERY_HASHES_CAP`=8) via `MemoryRepository::mark_used` (never touches `updated_at`) on a spawned best-effort task off the reply path — count + distinct-query fingerprints are the dreaming signals
- **Dreaming / consolidation** (OpenClaw-borrowed, on by default — nightly `0 3 * * *`, set `dream_schedule = "off"` to disable): `domain::memory::dream_verdict`/`dream_score` decide each **candidate**'s fate purely from accumulated usage — recalled ≥`DREAM_MIN_RECALL_COUNT`(3) **by ≥`DREAM_MIN_UNIQUE_QUERIES`(2) lexically-distinct queries** (the `recall_query_hashes` fingerprints — OpenClaw's `minUniqueQueries`; one repeated question can no longer pump a candidate to active on count alone, and pre-fingerprint candidates wait until diversity accrues) → promote to `Active`+`Inferred` (recallable, but still **not** L1-pinnable — pinning stays confirmed-only/manual); a candidate older than `DREAM_FORGET_AGE_DAYS`(30) that has gone **cold** (never recalled, or not recalled within that window — measured on `last_used_at`, so *weakly* recalled candidates are retired too rather than lingering forever) → `Archived`. (`dream_score` still ranks the `komo dream` preview but no longer gates: with recall-count its dominant term, a score threshold could never reject anything the count gate accepted, so it was removed.) `agent::daemon::DreamSweep` applies it (scheduled via `dream_schedule`, wired in `cli/gateway.rs`; `komo dream [--apply]` is the operator preview/run, showing `recalls=/queries=` per candidate). Only candidates are touched — active/user-saved memories are left to the operator (`komo memory report`). Importance is proven by use, not guessed at write time. Reviewer/`memory`-tool write guidance follows Hermes: declarative facts not instructions, nothing stale-in-a-week; the `memory` tool reports the L1 pinned-budget usage% on save/list to nudge self-curation

`domain/run.rs` + `RunRepository` (impl in `infra/persistence/db.rs`) — the **run ledger**: an execution/audit record of every agent turn (roadmap §7)
- one `Run` per turn (`id`, `session_id`, `input`, `plan` summary, `status` running/done/failed, `final_output`, `error`, timestamps) and one `RunStep` per tool call (`seq`, `tool_name`, `args`, `result`, `error`, `ok`, timestamps). Lives in `state.db` — execution state bound to a session, disposable like messages, **not** durable personal data
- steps are captured inside the tool executor (see `services/tool_execution/`), so the ledger covers every executed call. `RunContext` carries a shared `seq` counter so steps order stably even across the tool's spawned task
- every write is best-effort (warn-logged, never fails a turn or a tool) — same contract as memory `mark_used`
- **redaction**: step `args` are stored verbatim *except* each `Tool` may scrub its own via `Tool::redact_args` (default identity) — `shell` strips secret-looking substrings (`key=value`, `Bearer`, `--password`, high-entropy tokens), `file` drops the write `content` body. `result` is truncated but not scrubbed (shell *output* can still contain secrets — accepted, `state.db` is local/disposable). Fields are length-capped (`RUN_FIELD_CAP`/`STEP_FIELD_CAP`)
- aux sub-agents and maintenance sweeps run without a `RunContext`, so their tool use never enters the ledger
- operator view: `komo run list [--limit N]` / `komo run inspect <id>` (`cli/inspect.rs`)
- **resume** (roadmap §6): the ledger is an audit record, not a checkpoint — intermediate assistant turns are never persisted and step args are redacted/truncated, so faithful mid-loop replay is impossible by design. Instead `komo run resume [<id>]` (`cli/resume.rs`) re-dispatches one *fresh* turn in the interrupted run's session, primed by `domain::run::resume_prompt` (original input + a digest of completed steps, elided past `RESUME_DIGEST_CAP`); the model judges which side effects took hold, and new side effects go through approval as usual. `recoverable` is the resumable marker: set by `reconcile_interrupted` (gateway startup flips crash-residue `Running` runs to `Failed`/interrupted), cleared by `mark_resumed` after a resume dispatches (at-most-once), shown as `⟲` in `run list`. Only interruption makes a run recoverable — an ordinary `Failed` has no half-done steps worth handing over. While the gateway holds the db lock the whole action routes to `POST /api/runs/{id}/resume` (trusted for loopback callers, same rule as chat); otherwise the turn runs in-process like `komo chat` with `CliApprover`. No automatic resume: replaying half-done side effects unattended is not acceptable — resume is always an explicit operator action

`domain/skill.rs` + `infra/skills.rs` + `infra/skill_install.rs` + `services/skill_registry.rs` + `tools/skill.rs` — the **skill subsystem** (roadmap §9): skills are `SKILL.md` files, and the filesystem is the single source of truth
- `Skill` carries governance frontmatter next to identity: `protected` (operator-edit-only — the reviewer writes **no** candidate proposal, so a "just promote it" nudge can never overwrite the operator's version), `disabled` (kept on disk + inspectable, hidden from the model's catalog; `skill view` answers with its state, not its instructions), `source` (`user` | `reviewer` | `learned` provenance — `learned` marks the on-demand `skill learn` action below, distinct from the reviewer's passive `reviewer` extraction). `valid_skill_name` is the path-segment floor that keeps an LLM-suggested name inside the skills tree
- the `skill` tool has four actions: `list` / `view` (progressive disclosure the model uses to load a playbook), `learn`, and `install`. **learn** is the **on-demand distillation** path — when the user asks to "记住这个流程 / 存成 skill", the model calls `skill{action:"learn", name, description, instructions}`; it writes a `learned`-tagged **candidate** through the same `FsSkillStore::save` path as the reviewer (never active, refuses a protected active skill / path-escaping name), so it goes through the identical triage ladder (the active analog of the reviewer's passive extraction — no separate distillation LLM pass). **install** is the **remote-fetch** path — `skill{action:"install", source}` fetches a skill the user points at and, once the operator **approves** (`ApprovalRequest::normal`, scope key `skill:install`, so `/approve session` covers a batch), installs it **active** (the governance exception: install always has a human in the loop — an operator CLI invocation or an approved tool call — so unlike learn it doesn't detour through candidate). Denied ⇒ nothing fetched or written
- `infra/skill_install.rs` is the shared installer behind both the `skill` tool's `install` action and the `komo skills install` CLI. `resolve_source` maps a source string to either a **git clone** (`owner/repo`, `owner/repo/subpath`, a GitHub `tree`/`blob` URL, or any `*.git`/`git@` URL — shallow-cloned via the `git` binary) or a **single raw `SKILL.md` fetch** (a `.md` URL, or a GitHub `blob` link rewritten to `raw.githubusercontent.com`). The whole fetch stages in a temp dir (removed on drop) and is copied into the store only after a valid `SKILL.md` is located, so a failed clone/fetch leaves nothing behind; `locate_skill_dir` resolves the subpath, or the repo root, or — with no subpath — the sole `SKILL.md` in the tree (multiple ⇒ an error listing the choices). `safe_join` rejects `..`/absolute subpaths so a repo can't escape its checkout. `FsSkillStore::install_active_dir` copies the **whole skill directory** (SKILL.md + scripts/`references/`, `copy_dir_all` skipping `.git`), so multi-file skills install intact — distinct from `save`, which only renders a single-file candidate; it refuses to overwrite a protected active skill, matching the `save` floor
- `FsSkillStore` (`infra/skills.rs`) owns the governed store `~/.komo/skills/`: `<name>/SKILL.md` is active; `.candidates/<name>/SKILL.md` is a reviewer proposal (invisible to the runtime until promoted); `.candidates/<name>/.history/<ts>.md` rolls prior proposal versions. Its `SkillRepository` impl is the **automated write path**: `save` only ever writes a candidate — same triage ladder as memory candidates. The **install path** (`install_active_dir`) is the deliberate exception that writes active, gated by operator/approval upstream. A one-time import (wiring) moves skills a pre-filesystem komo accumulated in `komo.db` into the candidate pile (`.imported-from-db` marker)
- `SkillRegistry` is the per-process runtime view over the skill dirs (`KOMO_SKILLS_PATH`, `<workspace>/skills`, `<workspace>/.claude/skills`, `~/.komo/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`; first name wins). It **re-scans those dirs on every query** (`SkillRegistry::snapshot`), so a skill installed/promoted/enabled/disabled on disk shows up on the `skill` tool's next `list`/`view` with **no gateway restart** — the filesystem is the source of truth, matching `FsSkillStore` and the `komo skills` CLI (which previously saw disk changes the running agent's `skill` tool did not). The one thing still frozen at startup is the **capped skills catalog in the system prompt** (`skills_note`, `catalog_capped`): it lives in the cache-stable prompt tier, so it stays a startup snapshot to preserve prompt caching — but it's only a bounded teaser that tells the model to call `skill` list for the full, live set, so a newly added skill is discoverable immediately even though it's absent from that teaser until the next restart
- governance CLI (`cli/skill.rs`) is **pure file ops** — no db lock, everything works while the gateway runs: `list` / `install` / `inspect` / `promote` / `reject` / `protect` / `unprotect` / `enable` / `disable` (`install` also does network I/O via `skill_install`, but still no db lock; the operator running the shell command is the trust boundary, so it lands active directly). Only `skills audit` touches the db (it derives "which turns loaded this skill" from the run ledger's `skill view` steps via `RunRepository::steps_by_tool` + `domain::run::step_views_skill`; routed to `GET /api/skills/{name}/audit` when the gateway holds the lock). No usage counters are stored anywhere — the audit is always derived

`cli/journey.rs` — `komo journey`, a read-only **learning timeline** across the two learning subsystems (memory §5 + skills §9), newest-first. Composes existing reads with **no new api endpoint or schema**: memories via `cli::memory::load_all` (gateway-over-HTTP when the lock is held, else the db directly), skills via `FsSkillStore` file mtimes (lock-free, like the skills CLI). Flattens each memory into born (`created_at`) + promoted/archived (`updated_at`, only when it moved past creation — the stores keep two timestamps, not a transition log, so these are *inferred*; rejected memories are skipped) and each skill into candidate/active events. `memory_events` and `finalize` (sort desc / `--since` filter / `--limit` cap) are pure and unit-tested. Deliberately **not** an execution log — that's `komo run list`

`tui/` — the full-screen chat TUI (ratatui), `komo chat`'s interface. A terminal is required on both ends (`cli/app.rs::require_terminal`; a piped invocation gets a pointer to the api channel — that is the scripting surface, roadmap §8). `main.rs::will_run_tui` mirrors the predicate to route tracing to `~/.komo/logs/chat-tui.log`, since a stderr log line would tear the alternate screen. Strictly a front end over two backends (`tui/mod.rs::connect`): `GatewayClient::chat` over trusted loopback when the gateway holds the db lock, else the in-process `AgentRuntime` — no protocol of its own. Layout: scrollable transcript (CJK-width-aware wrapping in `tui/ui.rs`, bottom-anchored scroll; agent replies render as markdown via `tui/markdown.rs` — pulldown-cmark events → styled logical lines, span-wrapped by `ui.rs::wrap_spans` with the same width rules; soft breaks stay line breaks so plain text is unchanged) · status line with a turn spinner · bordered input box (the user's entries show under a bare cyan `❯`). In local mode, tool approvals arrive over a channel (`tui/approver.rs::TuiApprover`, same `y`/`s`/`n` semantics as `cli/approver.rs::CliApprover`, which remains the stdin approver for `komo run resume`) and render as a modal; concurrent requests queue, one modal at a time, and a dropped modal reads as denial. Turn futures run on spawned tasks so the event loop (`tui/mod.rs`, `tokio::select!` over key events / turn results / approval prompts / a spinner tick) keeps handling keys mid-turn; one turn at a time per session. State + key handling live terminal-free in `tui/app.rs` (unit-tested); streaming output is deliberately not in v1.
- Session ids are program-managed (uuid v7); `komo chat` always starts a fresh session, and `/new`/`/clear` are equivalent — both rotate to a new client-side id. There is no user-supplied session id at the chat prompt and no `/session` subcommand. The one way to re-enter an existing session is `komo session resume <id>` (`tui/mod.rs::resume`): it reopens the TUI bound to that id so its transcript threads and the conversation continues, erroring if no such session exists (it never creates one). Routes over the gateway when the lock is held (verifying the id via `GET /api/sessions` first), else in-process against the db like `komo chat`.

`agent/daemon.rs` — background maintenance supervisor, hosted by the gateway (pattern borrowed from gbrain's `autopilot` supervisor)
- `Schedule` wraps `croner` (5-field Unix cron, e.g. `0 * * * *`); `Maintenance` trait is the scheduled unit of work
- `ReviewSweep` is the one fixed action: it delegates to the shared `agent/review_coordinator.rs::ReviewCoordinator` (`ReviewTrigger::Scheduled`) and maps the `ReviewReport` into its maintenance summary. The coordinator owns the whole protocol for **both** triggers — the cheap `review_candidates()` projection (session id + live user-turn count + `reviewed_through` watermark, no transcripts) decides which sessions have unseen turns, only those are loaded in full and reviewed, `mark_reviewed` advances the watermark best-effort (clamped against stale detached writes — see `SessionRepository::mark_reviewed`), and a per-session in-flight guard (process-local, RAII-released) means a post-turn review and a sweep hitting the same session review it once. The runtime's post-turn trigger (`ReviewTrigger::AfterTurn`, fired via the same coordinator instance every `review_interval` user turns) advances the same watermark, so the two never duplicate work. Beyond memories/skills, the reviewer also extracts commitments ("I'll do X", "waiting on Y") and captures them as `inbox` tasks tagged with the origin `source` + a content-derived `source_message_id` dedup key (`TaskRepository::find_by_source_message_id` guards against re-capturing across sweeps). Auto-extracted tasks only ever land in `inbox`, never `todo`; extracted memories land as `candidate` (scoped to the origin channel, deduped via the in-memory `seen_keys` set over the session's prior extractions), never pinned/active; and extracted skills land as **candidate files** (`~/.komo/skills/.candidates/`, protected skills refuse even proposals), never active — the user triages all three up the ladder (`komo task` / `komo memory promote|pin` / `komo skills promote|reject`).
- `ReminderSweep` delivers due reminders via `Notifier` every minute (10-min grace window; older ones are marked `missed`)
- `TaskSweep` notifies once when an open task comes due (the task stays open; `due_notified_at` is the at-most-once guard)
- `BriefingSweep` is the opt-in daily briefing (roadmap §4): it reads open tasks + recently-learned memories, builds the digest (`briefing_prompt` is the pure, clock-injected prompt builder — returns `None` when there's nothing worth a ping), and delivers it through the same `Notifier`. Only scheduled when `briefing_schedule` is set (no default — proactive pings stay opt-in); wired in `cli/gateway.rs`. The compose step prefers a **tool-capable agent turn** (roadmap §2): wiring's `briefing_runtime` is a second, small `AgentRuntime` on the aux model with a read-only tool set (time / web_fetch / web_search / skill / HA when configured — no shell/file/task/memory) and a `PolicyApprover` over a deny-all inner, so a `Risk::Normal` action passes only through an `unattended = true` policy rule; briefing skills (calendar, weather) are how external data gets in. One session per day (`briefing:YYYY-MM-DD`), every execution lands in the run ledger, and any error degrades to the original tool-less `llm.complete` so the briefing always goes out.
- `WorkdayGated` (also `agent/daemon.rs`) is a `Maintenance` decorator that gates any sweep to Chinese **working days** — the "上班才执行" gate. cron still picks the time slot; the gate decides whether today counts as a workday at all (statutory holiday → skip, ordinary weekend → skip, 调休 makeup weekend → run). Lookups go through `domain::workday::WorkdayCalendar`, degrading to a Monday–Friday default (`is_weekday`) on any data outage so a real workday never gets blocked. Opt-in via `briefing_workdays_only` (config.toml / `KOMO_BRIEFING_WORKDAYS_ONLY`); when on, `cli/gateway.rs` wraps the briefing sweep. Calendar impl is `infra/workday.rs::HolidayCalendar`: it fetches one year at a time from a free holiday API (`api.jiejiariapi.com`, `date → isOffDay`) and caches each year to `~/.komo/workdays/{year}.json` — fetched the first time any date in a year is queried, then reused (a yearly refresh, no extra cron). `komo workday [date]` is the operator probe (also primes the cache).
- `supervise` is the loop: sleep to the next cron fire, run the cycle, isolate per-cycle failures, and trip a circuit breaker after 5 consecutive failures
- the OS-level supervisor is `cli/service.rs` (`komo gateway start/stop/restart/status`) and is macOS-only: `launchd` owns `komo gateway` with `KeepAlive` auto-restart + `RunAtLoad` at login. On Linux/container deployments, run bare `komo gateway` in the foreground and let Docker/Compose/systemd own start/stop/restart.

`agent/gateway.rs` — always-on gateway (pattern borrowed from hermes-agent's gateway: a persistent process hosting background services + ingress)
- `MessageHandler` (`domain/gateway.rs`) is the pure seam between a transport and the agent; `AgentRuntime` implements it (an inbound message is one session turn)
- `Channel` trait = a pluggable ingress; `Gateway` hosts N channels + N `MaintenanceService`s (the `daemon.rs` supervisor loop — review sweep on the config schedule, reminder + task sweeps every minute, optional daily briefing), all sharing one `watch` shutdown signal
- channels are declared in `~/.komo/config.toml` and constructed in `cli/gateway.rs`; `feishu`, `telegram`, `wechat`, and `homeassistant` (event ingress) are the wired channels
- sender admission is two-layered: each channel's `admit` filters message shape (non-text, bot senders, group mention gate), then the shared `PairingGuard` (`agent/pairing.rs`, store in `domain/pairing.rs`) decides identity — config `allow_from` is pre-trusted, approved pairings pass, anyone else gets a pairing code (`komo pair approve <code>` on the host admits them; `cli/pair.rs`)
- `GatewayDispatcher` (`agent/interaction.rs`) is the front door between a channel and the agent: a channel builds a `ReplySink` (`domain/gateway.rs`) for the chat and hands it each inbound message; the dispatcher classifies chat control commands and otherwise runs a turn. Channels no longer await turns or send agent replies themselves — the dispatcher owns that, and runs each turn on a spawned task so the receive loop keeps polling (which is what lets an `/approve` reply arrive mid-turn). One turn at a time per session.
- chat control commands (any channel): `/new` (also `/clear`, `/reset`) rotates the session hermes-style (`SessionRepository::rotate` archives the old transcript under a fresh id, leaving the chat's session empty — the reviewer can still see it), clears approval state, and clears the session's working todo list; `/approve` (+ `/approve session`) and `/deny` resolve a pending approval; `/sethome` (also `/home`) makes the current chat the home channel for proactive output (persisted via `HomeRepository`, `domain/home.rs`); `/wechat login` (also `/weixin`) provisions the WeChat channel by sending its login QR **into the current chat** as a photo — so an already-working channel (e.g. Telegram) sets up WeChat with no host shell. It drives the `WeChatLogin` trait (`domain/gateway.rs`, impl `WeChatQrLogin` in `infra/messaging/wechat.rs`), which writes creds and pulses a `Notify` the WeChat channel's `serve` loop is waiting on, so it comes online without a restart
- home channel + shutdown notice (hermes-borrowed): a single `HomeNotifier` (`infra/messaging/home_notifier.rs`) delivers all proactive output — reminders, task due notices, and the gateway's shutdown notice. It resolves the home at notify-time: the `/sethome` override (db, a `{platform}:{chat_id}` session id) wins over the config `home_chat` fallback (feishu first), degrading to the macOS notifier when no chat home resolves. On shutdown the gateway sends an "offline" notice through it (bounded by `SHUTDOWN_NOTICE_TIMEOUT`) before tearing down — only wired when a chat channel exists, so a foreground Ctrl-C with no channels stays quiet
- interactive tool approval over chat (ported from hermes' gateway approval): the gateway wires `ChatApprover` (`agent/interaction.rs`), not a deny-everything approver. When a side-effecting tool requests approval (`Risk::Normal`/`Dangerous`), the agent sends a prompt to the chat and the turn suspends on a `oneshot` registered in the shared `ApprovalState` (keyed by session, 5-min timeout); the user's `/approve`/`/deny` resolves it. `Risk::Safe` actions run without asking. With no chat session in context (maintenance sweeps, aux sub-agents) approval is denied. The turn's session context (id + `ReplySink`) reaches the approver via a task-local in `services::tool_execution` that the executor re-establishes across its `tokio::spawn`.
- background install: `komo gateway start` (see `cli/service.rs`) supervises it with launchd on macOS only; bare `komo gateway` is the foreground process for Docker/Linux and the process launchd invokes on macOS

`infra/messaging/feishu.rs` — the feishu integration: `FeishuChannel` (ingress), `FeishuSender` (outbound: cached tenant token + send; also a `TextSender` for the shared `HomeNotifier`)
- receives `im.message.receive_v1` over Feishu's WebSocket long connection (open-lark, no public callback URL needed); replies via the IM REST API with plain reqwest
- the ws connection runs on a dedicated thread with a current-thread runtime because open-lark's event dispatcher is not `Send`; events cross back over an mpsc channel
- `admit` filters message shape: `require_mention` for group chats, non-text and bot-sent messages dropped; sender identity goes through the shared `PairingGuard`
- session id is `feishu:{chat_id}`, so each chat is one continuous session; group @mention placeholders are stripped

`infra/messaging/telegram.rs` — the telegram integration: `TelegramChannel` (ingress), `TelegramSender` (outbound send; also a `TextSender` for the shared `HomeNotifier`)
- receives messages via `getUpdates` long polling (no public callback URL needed); plain reqwest against the Bot API, no SDK dependency
- `admit` mirrors the feishu policy: `require_mention` (group text must contain `@bot_username`, resolved via `getMe` at startup), non-text and bot-sent messages dropped; sender identity goes through the shared `PairingGuard`
- session id is `telegram:{chat_id}`; replies are sent with `parse_mode=Markdown` (rich formatting), falling back to plain chunked text when the API rejects the Markdown or the reply exceeds 4096 UTF-16 units

`infra/messaging/wechat.rs` — the WeChat (微信) integration over the **iLink** personal-bot protocol, built on the `wechatbot` crate (HTTP/JSON long-polling against `ilinkai.weixin.qq.com`, no public callback URL). `WeChatChannel` (ingress) + `WeChatSender` (outbound, also a `TextSender`) **share one `WeChatBot` instance** (built by `build_bot`, wired in `cli/gateway.rs`) — required because the crate keeps each user's reply `context_token` in memory, populated by the poll loop, and `send` needs it.
- the crate owns its own poll loop (`WeChatBot::run`) and fires a **synchronous** `on_message` callback, so the channel adapts rather than drives: the handler clones the message and `tokio::spawn`s the async pairing + `dispatcher.handle`, then `serve` hands the thread to `run()` under a shutdown `select!` (dropping the `run()` future cancels the poll)
- login is **QR-based**; creds → `~/.komo/wechat/credentials.json`. Provision either on the host with `komo channel wechat login` (`cli/wechat.rs`, renders the QR in-terminal via the `qrcode` crate) or from chat with `/wechat login` (the QR is sent into the chat as a photo — see the chat-commands list). `WeChatChannel::serve` **waits** for the cred file on an `Arc<Notify>` shared with `WeChatQrLogin` (it doesn't die without creds), so a chat-provisioned login brings the channel online with no restart. QR→PNG is `render_qr_png` (qrcode matrix → `image` crate, png feature only); photo delivery is `ReplySink::send_photo` (default errors; Telegram overrides it via `sendPhoto`)
- **DM-only**: an iLink bot identity can't join ordinary WeChat groups, so there's no group/mention gate — `PairingGuard` (`platform = "wechat"`) is the only admission control. Session id is `wechat:{user_id}`
- known limitation: proactive output (reminders/briefing via `HomeNotifier`) reaches a user only after they've messaged the bot since process start (the `context_token` map is in-memory, not persisted). The `wechatbot` crate also forces `reqwest`'s default TLS (native-tls/openssl) rather than komo's rustls — accepted tech-debt; switching needs a vendored patch

`cli/gateway.rs` — wires the `gateway` subcommand; `cli/wiring.rs` — shared `AgentRuntime` construction used by both chat and gateway (differ only in the `Approver`)

## Key extension points

- **Add a tool**: implement `Tool` in `src/tools/`, register it in `cli/wiring.rs`
- **Swap LLM provider**: implement `LlmClient` (`domain/llm.rs`) for another backend and construct it in `cli/wiring.rs` (`build_llm`)
- **Swap persistence**: implement `SessionRepository + MessageRepository` for a different backend; no changes needed in `agent/` or `domain/`
- **Add agent-loop control** (hard budget / resume — roadmap §7): the tool loop lives in-house at `AgentRuntime::run_agent_loop`, so add control points there, between rounds. Retry and the per-call fan-out budget live inside `ToolExecutor`; the loop owns the `max_turns` round budget. A new round-level signal is a new `Step` variant or a sentinel tool the loop recognizes; `LlmClient::begin_turn`/`TurnDriver` is the seam to extend, not rig. **Clarify is shipped as the sentinel-tool form**: `tools/ask_user.rs` suspends the turn on a per-session oneshot in `services/clarify.rs::ClarifyState` (2 questions/turn budget, 10-min timeout, degrades to guidance text everywhere nobody can answer); the gateway dispatcher routes the next plain message into it as the answer, the TUI does the same in local mode
- **Change the scheduled action**: implement `Maintenance` (`agent/daemon.rs`) and construct it in `cli/gateway.rs`
- **Add a gateway ingress**: implement `Channel` (`agent/gateway.rs`) for a new transport (TCP/HTTP/chat platform), `add_channel` it in `cli/gateway.rs`, gated by a `~/.komo/config.toml` declaration — `infra/messaging/feishu.rs` is the reference implementation

## Testing

Tests live beside the code with `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Use `#[tokio::test]` for async. Name tests by behavior (`time_tool_returns_non_empty_string`).

## Coding style

Default Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`), `snake_case` for modules/files/functions, `PascalCase` for structs and enums. CLI subcommands stay short and verb-based. Prefer small modules with one responsibility; keep async database code close to the layer that owns it.

## Commit & PR style

Short imperative commit messages: `add file tool`, `wire llm client`. PRs include a concise description, commands run for verification, and terminal output when CLI behavior changes.
